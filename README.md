###### Abstract:
Sea Tides Never Stop is emergent, which is also an abstract artwork made by Dana Park, Qing Zhang, Yuming Wang and Zhen Tao. It can be displayed on any device and different simulation results appear randomly. Through this artwork we hope to show part of the meaning of life —— that the tide exists every day, as alive as life; that the movement of the tide, regular, but ever-changing, as the same as life. Whenever users refresh the webpage, it will show the movement of curves randomly, which is interesting and meaningful.
